          Match-Er connects nearby tennis players, letting users friend each other, invite each other to matches, 
          schedule matches, and track match scores as well as their overall record.
        </p>
        <p class="project-challenges">
          Building Match-Er presented some challenges. For one, it was the first full stack application I built with React 
          and Redux. At first it was difficult to "think in React." However, it soon clicked, and
          I realized the incredible benefits of React. Another challenge was Match-Er required a more complicated back end than
          I had done before. The Express Router was immensely useful in compartmentalizing the code, and Mongoose's subdocuments
          made constructing and using the data models a smooth process.

          Task Timer tracks how long users spend doing typical tasks such as checking their email, reading the news,
          spending time on social media, or studying.
        </p>
        <p class="project-challenges">
          One big challenge I encountered in building Task Timer was, halfway through the project, I shifted the purpose of it. It originally
          was called "Cube JS," and was a Rubik's cube timer that tracked a user's solve times, provided scrambling algorithms, and kept users' notes
          on solves. I realized that wouldn't be useful or interesting to most users, so the scope of the app was broadened. I built the timer from 
          scratch with JavaScript, and that was a fun puzzle.

          Retro YouTube plays YouTube videos on a 3D model of a retro television. The user controls the video with a 
          remote that renders when the site is loaded on mobile.
        </p>
        <p class="project-challenges">
          Retro YouTube was the first real web-app I built. It was a difficult challenge to figure out how to display and position 
          a 3D model of a television in the browser as well as rotate the video's iframe three dimensionally with the television. I used 
          the Three.js library to solve those problems. Another challenge was figuring out the functionality of connecting the device displaying the 
          television with the device acting as the remote. I resolved that issue with the Socket.IO library.
